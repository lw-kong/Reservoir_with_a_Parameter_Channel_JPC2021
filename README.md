Codes of our publication: [Kong, Ling-Wei, Huawei Fan, Celso Grebogi, and Ying-Cheng Lai. "Emergence of transient chaos and intermittency in machine learning." Journal of Physics: Complexity (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-072X/ac0b00). Based on the same framework from [our previous work](https://github.com/lw-kong/Reservoir_with_a_Parameter_Channel_PRR2021)(That repository contains more comments.).
Also included the codes for hyperparameter optimization.
